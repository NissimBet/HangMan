# HangMan
Hangman Project

This project I have done by myself. It consists of a list of words, one of the words is selected and the player has to guess the letters of the word or the word itself. The user is also able to use his own list of words, as long as it is a .txt file. This project was given for as a final project for Programming Fundamentals class.

It is not yet finished and contains bugs
